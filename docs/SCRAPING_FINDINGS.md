# Web Scraping Status and Findings

**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Status**: Blocked by anti-scraping measures

## Executive Summary

After testing the target websites for Milestone 1, we've encountered significant blockers that prevent standard web scraping:

1. **West Elm (westelm.com)**: ❌ **403 Forbidden** - Anti-scraping protection active
2. **Orange Tree (orangetree.com)**: ❌ **Connection Failed** - Website appears to be down or non-existent

## Detailed Findings

### 1. West Elm (westelm.com)

**Testing Results:**
- HTTP Status: `403 Forbidden`
- Test URL: `https://www.westelm.com/shop/furniture/sofas-sectionals/`
- User Agent Tested: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36`

**Analysis:**
West Elm has implemented anti-scraping measures that block automated requests. This is common for large e-commerce websites to:
- Prevent competitor price monitoring
- Protect against data harvesting
- Reduce server load from bots
- Comply with terms of service

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ curl -A "Mozilla/5.0..." https://www.westelm.com/shop/furniture/sofas-sectionals/
HTTP/403 Forbidden
```

### 2. Orange Tree (orangetree.com)

**Testing Results:**
- HTTP Status: `000` (Connection failed)
- Test URL: `https://www.orangetree.com/living-room/`
- Error: `ECONNREFUSED` / No connection

**Analysis:**
The orangetree.com domain either:
- Does not exist
- Is currently down
- Has DNS issues
- Is behind a firewall blocking our IP range

**Recommendation:** Replace with an alternative furniture retailer that allows scraping.

## Infrastructure Status

✅ **Completed Setup:**
- Scrapy framework installed and configured
- PostgreSQL database schema created
- Spider code written and organized
- Database pipelines implemented
- Settings and configuration files created
- Scraping manager and CLI tools ready

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- Pipeline settings configuration
- Database session management
- Scrapy settings module structure

⚠️ **Current Blocker:**
- Cannot access target websites to scrape

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Use Alternative Data Sources (Recommended)

Replace the blocked/unavailable websites with scraping-friendly alternatives:

**Furniture Retailers that May Allow Scraping:**
1. **Wayfair** (wayfair.com) - Has public API and may allow limited scraping
2. **Overstock** (overstock.com) - Large furniture selection
3. **Article** (article.com) - Modern furniture retailer
4. **AllModern** (allmodern.com) - Contemporary furniture
5. **Houzz** (houzz.com) - Design and furniture marketplace

**Action Items:**
- Research robots.txt and terms of service for alternatives
- Test accessibility with curl/scrapy
- Update spiders with new domains and selectors

### Option 2: Use Headless Browser / JavaScript Rendering

For websites with anti-bot protection:

**Tools:**
- **Scrapy-Selenium**: Integrate Selenium with Scrapy for JavaScript rendering
- **Scrapy-Playwright**: Modern alternative to Selenium
- **Scrapy-Splash**: Lightweight JavaScript rendering service

**Implementation:**
```bash
pip install scrapy-selenium selenium
pip install webdriver-manager
```

**Pros:**
- Can bypass basic anti-bot measures
- Renders JavaScript-heavy sites
- More realistic browsing behavior

**Cons:**
- Significantly slower (5-10x)
- Higher resource usage
- May still be detected and blocked

### Option 3: Use Scraping Services/Proxies

Professional scraping infrastructure:

**Services:**
- **ScraperAPI** (scraperapi.com) - $49/month for 100K requests
- **ScrapingBee** (scrapingbee.com) - $49/month for 50K credits
- **Bright Data** (brightdata.com) - Enterprise pricing

**Features:**
- Rotating proxies
- Anti-bot bypass
- CAPTCHA solving
- Geographic diversity

**Pros:**
- Professional infrastructure
- Handles anti-bot protection
- Scalable and reliable

**Cons:**
- Monthly subscription costs
- Usage limits
- External dependency

### Option 4: Use Official APIs (Best Practice)

Check if retailers provide official APIs:

**Potential API Sources:**
- **Wayfair API**: May have partner program
- **Google Shopping API**: Aggregates many retailers
- **Amazon Product Advertising API**: If including Amazon furniture
- **Shopify API**: For Shopify-based furniture stores

**Pros:**
- Legal and ethical
- Structured, clean data
- Reliable and maintained
- Better performance

**Cons:**
- Limited coverage
- May require approval
- Usage limits/costs

### Option 5: Purchase Datasets

Pre-scraped furniture product data:

**Sources:**
- **Kaggle Datasets**: Free furniture datasets
- **Data.world**: Open data platform
- **Bright Data Data Store**: Purchase pre-scraped data
- **Amazon AWS Data Exchange**: Commercial datasets

**Pros:**
- Immediate availability
- Clean, structured data
- No scraping infrastructure needed

**Cons:**
- May not be current
- Limited to available datasets
- Potential licensing restrictions

## Recommended Path Forward

**For Milestone 1 Completion:**

1. **Immediate Action (Option 1)**:
   - Replace orangetree.com with a working alternative (e.g., Article.com, AllModern.com)
   - Test 2-3 alternative furniture websites for scraping viability
   - Update spider configurations for accessible websites

2. **For West Elm (Choose one)**:
   - **Option A**: Find 2 alternative furniture retailers that allow scraping
   - **Option B**: Implement Scrapy-Selenium for anti-bot bypass
   - **Option C**: Use ScraperAPI or similar service (if budget allows)

3. **Update Project Documentation**:
   - Document which websites are being scraped
   - Update milestone requirements if needed
   - Record any terms of service compliance considerations

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

⚠️ **Important Reminders:**

1. **Respect robots.txt**: Always check and honor robots.txt directives
2. **Terms of Service**: Review ToS for scraping policies
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays to avoid overloading servers
4. **Data Privacy**: Don't scrape personal or sensitive information
5. **Attribution**: Consider crediting data sources in your application

## Next Steps

Please choose one of the recommended paths above so we can:
1. Update the spider configurations
2. Test the new data sources
3. Complete the Milestone 1 scraping requirements

## Testing Commands

Once we have viable websites, test with:

```bash
# Test website accessibility
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -A "Mozilla/5.0..." [URL]

# Test with Scrapy shell
scrapy shell "[URL]"

# Run test scrape
python scripts/run_scraping.py spider [spider_name] --delay 2

# Check scraping logs
python scripts/run_scraping.py status
```
