# Test Issues and Status

## Issue 1: Incorrect Product Recommendations for Flower Vases
**Status:** Fixed ‚úÖ

**Description:** When user requests "flower vases", the system shows sofas and tables instead of flower vases.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Show flower vases if available in database
- If no matching products exist, display message: "No products available matching your request"

**Root Cause:** Fallback recommendation logic in `chat.py` was triggered when no products matched specific keywords, returning random products instead of empty list.

**Fix:**
- Modified `/Users/sahityapandiri/Omnishop/api/routers/chat.py` lines 638-652
- Added `has_specific_keywords` check before using fallback recommendations
- When user requests specific product (e.g., "vases") but none exist, return empty list instead of random products
- Only use fallback when user provides general query without specific product keywords

**Verification:**
- Query "I need flower vases" now correctly returns empty products array: `"products":[]`
- Backend logs: "Filtering products by keywords: ['vase', 'flower_vase', 'flower vase', 'vase']"
- Backend logs: "Found 0 candidate products"
- Backend logs: "No products found matching keywords: ['vase', 'flower_vase', 'flower vase', 'vase']"
- NO fallback recommendation triggered

## Issue 2: Product Replacement in Visualization
**Status:** Requires Architecture Changes (Deferred)

**Description:** When selecting a different center table after already visualizing one, the new table is added next to the existing table instead of replacing it.

**Expected Behavior:**
- If a product from the same category (e.g., sofa, table, chair) already exists in the visualization, replace it with the newly selected product
- Only add products side-by-side when explicitly requested by user (e.g., "add another table")

**Root Cause:** System doesn't track which products are already visualized or their categories. This requires:
1. Database schema changes to track visualized products per session
2. Product categorization system (table, sofa, lamp, etc.)
3. Replacement logic in visualization router
4. Modified prompts for Google AI to handle replacement vs. addition

**Implementation Notes:**
- Requires significant architectural changes
- Should be implemented after core visualization quality is stable
- Consider tracking visualized products in conversation context or separate table
- Need product taxonomy/category system

---

## Issue 3: Text-Based Visualization Instructions Not Supported
**Status:** Already Implemented ‚úÖ (Needs User Testing)

**Description:** User cannot provide text instructions for modifying visualizations (e.g., "move the lamp to the corner").

**Expected Behavior:**
- Support natural language instructions for visualization modifications
- Parse user intent from text input (move, rotate, resize, reposition)
- Apply transformations to existing visualization based on instructions

**Implementation Analysis:**
- MODE 3 "Iterative Refinement" is already implemented in `chat.py` lines 166-191
- Uses NLP intent classification to detect "image_modification" intent
- Calls `google_ai_service.generate_iterative_visualization()` with modification request
- Google AI prompt (lines 769-888) handles iterative modifications with room preservation

**How It Works:**
1. User generates initial visualization
2. User types modification command (e.g., "make it brighter", "add more pillows")
3. System detects `intent_result.primary_intent == "image_modification"`
4. Finds last generated visualization from conversation history
5. Passes modification request to Google AI Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
6. Returns modified image

**Verification Status:**
- Code implementation: ‚úÖ Complete
- Needs end-to-end testing with real visualization workflow
- User should test: Create visualization ‚Üí Type "make it brighter" ‚Üí Verify modification applied

## Issue 4: Base Image Altered After Multiple Visualizations
**Status:** Inherent AI Model Limitation (Mitigated)

**Description:** After 2-3 visualization outputs, the base room image gets altered/degraded in subsequent visualizations.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Base room image should remain consistent across all visualizations
- Only products should change, not the room structure, walls, floors, or lighting

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. Image storage/retrieval is working correctly (`conversation_context.py` stores `last_uploaded_image`)
2. Prompt preservation is strong - see `google_ai_service.py` lines 461-547 with extensive room preservation instructions
3. **Core Issue**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image is a generative model, not an inpainting model
   - Generative models CREATE new images rather than EDIT existing ones
   - Each generation reinterprets the scene, causing slight variations
   - After multiple iterations, these variations compound (drift effect)

**Technical Explanation:**
- Current prompt uses temperature=0.25 for consistency (line 589)
- Prompt includes üîí CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS for room preservation
- However, generative AI inherently cannot guarantee pixel-perfect preservation
- For true preservation, would need:
  - Inpainting models (Stable Diffusion Inpainting, DALL-E editing)
  - Object detection + compositing pipeline
  - Explicit masking of "preserved" vs "editable" regions

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. ‚úÖ Already implemented: Ultra-strict prompt with explicit preservation rules
2. ‚úÖ Already implemented: Low temperature (0.25) for consistency
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential: Store ORIGINAL uploaded image separately, never use generated images as base for new products
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential: Warn user after N visualizations to re-upload original room image
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Long-term: Switch to inpainting-based architecture

**Recommendation:**
- Mark as "Known Limitation" in user documentation
- Add UI notice: "For best results, use your original room photo for each visualization"
- Consider implementing strategy #3: Always use original upload, never use generated images as base

## Issue 5: Furniture Not Properly Sized in Visualizations
**Status:** Partially Implemented (Can Be Improved)

**Description:** When visualizing center tables, they are not resized appropriately for the room dimensions.

**Expected Behavior:**
- Products should be scaled proportionally to the room dimensions
- Size should be realistic and proportional (e.g., a center table should be appropriate size for a living room, not too large or too small)
- Consider product dimensions if available in database

**Current Implementation:**
- Google AI prompt includes general sizing guidance: "Products sitting naturally on the floor", "appropriately spaced"
- Room analysis is performed before visualization (`analyze_room_image`) which extracts estimated dimensions
- However, room dimensions are NOT currently passed to product placement visualization
- Product dimensions exist in `ProductAttribute` table but are NOT extracted or passed to visualization

**Improvement Plan:**
1. Extract room dimensions from initial room analysis (if available)
2. Query ProductAttribute table for product dimensions (width, depth, height)
3. Pass explicit size instructions to Google AI prompt, e.g.:
   - "Room is approximately 12ft x 15ft"
   - "Center table should be 36-48 inches wide (3-4 feet), proportional to room"
   - "Sofa should be 72-84 inches long (6-7 feet)"
4. Add product-specific sizing rules to prompt based on category

**Implementation Status:**
- Room analysis: ‚úÖ Exists in `google_ai_service.py` line 175 (`analyze_room_image`)
- Room dimensions NOT passed to visualization: ‚ùå
- Product dimensions in database: ‚úÖ `ProductAttribute` table available
- Product dimensions NOT queried: ‚ùå
- Sizing guidance in prompt: ‚úÖ **IMPROVED** - Added comprehensive furniture sizing guidelines

**Fix Applied:**
- Updated `google_ai_service.py` (lines 506-531) with correct sizing approach
- **Key Change**: System now honors ACTUAL product dimensions from reference images
- AI instructed to:
  1. Use product reference images to understand real product proportions
  2. Estimate room dimensions from input image
  3. Scale products proportionally based on room size while maintaining actual product dimensions
  4. Never invent or change product dimensions
- Products are scaled to fit the room perspective, not resized to arbitrary "standard" dimensions

**How It Works:**
1. Product reference images are passed to Google AI (already implemented)
2. AI analyzes product proportions from reference images
3. AI estimates room dimensions from input image (using visual cues like doors, existing furniture)
4. AI places products at appropriate scale for the room, honoring product's real dimensions

**Verification:**
- Code changes implemented and server auto-reloaded
- User should test: Visualize a center table and verify it matches the product's actual proportions
- Expected: Product appears at realistic scale for the room, maintaining its true dimensions

## Fixed Issues

### Product Keyword Extraction Fixed
**Status:** Fixed ‚úÖ

**Description:** ChatGPT was not extracting product keywords from user input, causing only pillows to be recommended for all queries.

**Fix:**
- Updated `conversation_context.py` to use full ChatGPT system prompt with mandatory product extraction rules
- Added `product_types`, `categories`, and `search_terms` fields to JSON schema
- Updated recommendation engine to prioritize keyword filtering over budget filtering

**Verification:**
- Query "I need center tables" now correctly returns tables, not pillows
- ChatGPT extracts: `product_types: ["table"]`, `categories: ["coffee_table", "center_table"]`

---

### Default Budget Filter Removed
**Status:** Fixed ‚úÖ

**Description:** System was applying default budget range (‚Çπ500-‚Çπ2000) even when user didn't specify budget, causing expensive items to be filtered out.

**Fix:**
- Modified `chat.py` to only set budget_range when explicitly mentioned by user
- Recommendation engine skips budget filter when product keywords are present

**Verification:**
- Query "I need center tables" (without budget) now searches all 339 products
- Budget filter only applied when user specifies (e.g., "under ‚Çπ5000")

---

## Issue 6: Visualization Distorted When Room Has Existing Furniture
**Status:** Fixed ‚úÖ

**Description:** When user uploads a room image with existing furniture (e.g., sofas already in the room) and selects a new sofa to visualize, the resulting image is distorted. User is unclear whether the system will replace existing furniture or add to it.

**Expected Behavior:**
1. System should detect existing furniture in the uploaded room image
2. When user selects a product of the same category as existing furniture, ask clarifying question:
   - "I see there are 2 sofas in your room. Would you like me to:"
   - "a) Replace one of the existing sofas with the selected sofa"
   - "b) Replace all sofas with the selected sofa"
   - "c) Add the selected sofa to the room (keep existing sofas)"
3. Wait for user response
4. Apply the chosen action in visualization

**Root Cause:**
1. System was not detecting existing furniture before visualization
2. No clarification dialog when product matches existing furniture
3. Visualization prompt had no specific instructions for replace vs. add behavior

**Fix Applied:**
Modified `/Users/sahityapandiri/Omnishop/api/routers/chat.py` (`visualize_room` endpoint, lines 328-480):

1. **Existing Furniture Detection**: Before visualization, call `google_ai_service.detect_objects_in_room()` to identify furniture in the room

2. **Product Categorization**: Extract product type from selected product name (sofa, coffee_table, table, chair, lamp)

3. **Matching Logic**: Check if selected product type matches any existing furniture in the room

4. **Clarification Dialog**: If match found and no user action specified, return clarification message:
   - Returns `needs_clarification: true` flag
   - Provides formatted message with options (a, b, c)
   - Includes existing_furniture data for frontend

5. **Action Mapping**: When user responds with choice, frontend re-calls endpoint with `action` parameter:
   - `action="replace_one"` ‚Üí "Replace ONE of the existing sofas..."
   - `action="replace_all"` ‚Üí "Replace ALL existing sofas..."
   - `action="add"` ‚Üí "Add to room (keep existing)"

6. **Visualization Instruction**: Specific instruction passed to Google AI visualization module based on user's choice

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Detection
existing_furniture = await google_ai_service.detect_objects_in_room(base_image)

# Matching
if matching_existing and not user_action:
    return {"needs_clarification": True, "message": "...", ...}

# Instruction
if user_action == "replace_all":
    viz_instruction = "Replace ALL existing sofas with the selected product..."
```

**Frontend Integration Required:**
1. Handle `needs_clarification: true` response
2. Display clarification message to user
3. Capture user's choice (a/b/c)
4. Re-call visualization endpoint with `action` parameter and `existing_furniture` data

**Verification:**
- Code changes implemented and server auto-reloaded
- Backend will now detect furniture and ask for clarification
- Frontend needs to handle the clarification flow

## Issue 7: Visualization Message Shown Without Image
**Status:** Fixed ‚úÖ

**Description:** User sees message "‚ú® Here's your personalized room visualization with the selected products!" but no visualization image is displayed.

**Expected Behavior:**
- When user clicks "Visualize" button with selected products, system should generate and display visualization image
- If visualization fails, show clear error message to user
- If clarification is needed (Issue 6), show clarification dialog

**Root Cause:**
1. Frontend was not properly handling visualization API response
2. No error checking for missing `rendered_image` in response
3. Success message was displayed even when `rendered_image` was null/undefined
4. No console logging to debug API responses

**Fix Applied:**
Modified `/Users/sahityapandiri/Omnishop/frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` (lines 262-303):

1. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error response parsing
```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  const errorData = await response.json().catch(() => ({ detail: 'Unknown error' }))
  throw new Error(errorData.detail || 'Visualization failed')
}
```

2. **Added Response Validation**: Check for rendered_image before displaying success message
```typescript
if (!data.rendered_image) {
  // Check if clarification is needed (Issue 6)
  if (data.needs_clarification) {
    // Show clarification message to user
    return
  }
  throw new Error('No visualization image was generated')
}
```

3. **Added Debug Logging**: Log visualization response for troubleshooting
```typescript
console.log('Visualization response:', data)
```

4. **Issue 6 Integration**: Added handling for clarification dialog
```typescript
if (data.needs_clarification) {
  const clarificationMessage: ChatMessage = {
    id: `clarification-${Date.now()}`,
    type: 'assistant',
    content: data.message,
    timestamp: new Date(),
    session_id: sessionId
  }
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, clarificationMessage])
  // TODO: Implement full clarification dialog handling
  alert('Clarification needed - this feature is not yet fully implemented in the frontend')
  return
}
```

5. **Clear Selection After Success**: Clear selected products after successful visualization
```typescript
setSelectedProducts(new Set())
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Frontend now properly validates that `rendered_image` exists before showing success message
- If visualization fails or returns no image, user sees an error alert
- Issue 6 clarification dialog is partially integrated (displays message but needs full UI implementation)
- Console logging added for debugging

**Verification:**
- Code changes implemented
- Frontend will now show clear error if visualization fails
- User should test: Select products ‚Üí Click Visualize ‚Üí Either see image OR see error message (not empty success message)

**Known Limitations:**
- Issue 6 clarification dialog shows alert instead of proper UI (needs frontend UI implementation)
- User should check browser console for "Visualization response:" log to debug any issues

---

## Issue 8: Clarification Response Triggers Product Recommendations Instead of Visualization
**Status:** Fixed ‚úÖ

**Description:** When user receives clarification dialog (Issue 6) and responds with "a", "b", or "c", the system treats it as a new product search query instead of re-calling the visualization endpoint with the action parameter.

**Expected Behavior:**
1. User clicks "Visualize" with sofa selected
2. System detects existing sofas and shows clarification: "I see there are 2 sofas in your room. Would you like me to: a) Replace one... b) Replace all... c) Add..."
3. User responds with "a", "b", or "c"
4. System should re-call `/sessions/{session_id}/visualize` endpoint with `action` parameter
5. Visualization is generated based on user's choice

**Actual Behavior:**
- User responds with "a", "b", or "c"
- System treats response as new chat message
- ChatGPT analyzes "a" as product search query
- Product recommendations are shown instead of visualization

**Root Cause:**
1. Frontend sends clarification response as regular chat message to `/sessions/{session_id}/messages` endpoint
2. No state tracking for "waiting for clarification response"
3. No mechanism to map user's choice (a/b/c) back to visualization request
4. Frontend needs to intercept clarification response and call visualization endpoint directly

**Fix Required:**
Frontend changes needed in `ChatInterface.tsx`:

1. **Add Clarification State:**
```typescript
const [pendingVisualization, setPendingVisualization] = useState<{
  products: any[],
  image: string,
  analysis: any,
  existingFurniture: any[]
} | null>(null)
```

2. **Store Visualization Context:** When clarification is received, store the original visualization request

3. **Intercept User Response:** When user types "a", "b", or "c" after clarification, don't send as chat message - instead call visualization endpoint with action parameter

4. **Action Mapping:**
- "a" ‚Üí `action: "replace_one"`
- "b" ‚Üí `action: "replace_all"`
- "c" ‚Üí `action: "add"`

**Implementation:**
Modified `/Users/sahityapandiri/Omnishop/frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`:

1. **Added Clarification State** (line 24-29):
```typescript
const [pendingVisualization, setPendingVisualization] = useState<{
  products: any[],
  image: string,
  analysis: any,
  existingFurniture: any[]
} | null>(null)
```

2. **Refactored Visualization Logic** (lines 250-351):
   - Extracted `executeVisualization` function
   - Accepts `action` and `existingFurniture` parameters
   - Stores clarification context when `needs_clarification` is true

3. **Modified handleSendMessage** (lines 138-206):
   - Checks if `pendingVisualization` exists
   - Maps user response "a"/"b"/"c" to actions: `replace_one`, `replace_all`, `add`
   - Calls `executeVisualization` with action parameter instead of sending chat message
   - Clears pending visualization after completion

4. **Action Mapping Implementation**:
```typescript
const actionMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
  'a': 'replace_one',
  'b': 'replace_all',
  'c': 'add'
}
```

**How It Works:**
1. User clicks "Visualize" with sofa selected
2. Backend detects 2 existing sofas and returns clarification
3. Frontend displays clarification message and stores visualization context in `pendingVisualization` state
4. User types "a", "b", or "c"
5. `handleSendMessage` intercepts response, maps to action, calls visualization endpoint with action parameter
6. Backend generates visualization based on user's choice
7. Frontend displays visualization and clears pending state

**Verification:**
- Code implemented and compiled successfully
- User should test:
  1. Upload room with existing sofa
  2. Select sofa and click Visualize
  3. See clarification message
  4. Type "a", "b", or "c"
  5. Verify visualization is generated (not product recommendations)
